# README

Part of Le Wagon's bootcamp challenge to make a 3-model app which introduces a many to many relationship (N:N). 
The challenge requires students to build a Watch List which allows users to create lists and save their favourite movies.

User actions in the app:

* As a user, I can see all my movie lists
* As a user, I can create a movie list
* As a user, I can see the details of a movie list
* As a user, I can bookmark a movie inside a movie list
* As a user, I can destroy a bookmark

Warning the movies are seeded in the database so there is no implemention of any user action around the movie model.
